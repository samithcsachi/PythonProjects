## Problem Statement 

By web scrapping the Job Site, Have created a Dataset which contains all details which can be used for machine learning projects. Using classification algorithm can develop a model which can predict the Average Salary of Data Scientist. 


## Tech Stack

- Python (refer to requirement.txt for the packages used in this project)
- Selenium 


## Lessons learned and recommendation
The initial plan was create a simple scraper using Selenium. When i was searching the main page of Stepstone i can get full list of Jobs and there details. But the issue is that the Salary range was only visible once I login. So i have used a dummy email id and password. Then i was trying to scrape from the main page itself all the details but realized that clicking the each link and opening in another tab will give more details such as description and company details. Once the Tab is opened we can scraped the details and then close the Tab and move to over to the main tab. I have set up the no of jobs to 100 so have written code mode to next screen and then continue the scrapping till the jobs are 100. Scraper was running smooth till 12th Page then came the main challenge for me it an error code. When i searched in google it says it is "Akamai Edge error". i was trying different method to tackle the error. So i have refreshed the site in code and also changed the time sleep to random and was able to tackle the error. 

- Learned to Tackle Akamai Edge error
- Can add code to scrape the description columns 


## Limitation and what can be improved

The Dataset can be used for machine learning purpose but if there are more features like programming language requirements , no of years experience required, other technical skills required. Machine learning model can be developed to check the average salary and also another model can be developed which can analyze the prerequisite for each job is as per the standard or not.
